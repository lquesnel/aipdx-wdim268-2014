The website I chose to review was www.losttype.com

Lost Type is one of my favorite websites. You have the ability to download very beautiful and professional font and font families for free.  

Minimalistic design with neutral colors – allows the content and the graphics/imagery to speak for itself. In this case, the graphics of the type speak for the website more than trying to make content and other imagery around the graphics too distracting. Content is also very minimal. There’s not a lot of unnecessary ‘garbage’ that is not important. There is an even amount of padding and marginal room between divs – allowing the content to help ‘breath’ better and not feel so crammed. 

Even though the purpose of Lost Type is to download fonts and read about the variety of typefaces, the website is still responsive for a cell phone. All content shrinks perfectly and is still contained in a nice div. Header and footer are responsive as well. 

There’s a small interactive area that allows the viewer to test the font size using something the designer labeled “typetester,” which helps enlarge or minimize the font size. When the CSS for the site is toggled off, the interactive area still works nicely, though it doesn’t showcase the font choice. With JavaScript toggled off the interactive area disappears. This area, labeled “fieldstate” is the only area that has a significant amount of changes with CSS and JavaScript enabled/disabled. 

With the CSS toggled off, the website still functions very nicely. The graphic elements sustain their actual sizes, but the divs with all the written content shrink appropriately to the screen. 

Personally, I have always loved this website. They have recently gone through a design change, and I think it was for the best, it’s much more organized and easy to navigate through. The design is very appealing to the eye. Type choices are easy to read as well, and all content is placed in proper divs which I believe helped the designer provide a nice amount of breathing room between other chunks of content and images.
